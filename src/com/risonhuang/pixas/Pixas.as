	 * Pixel art is a form of digital art, where images are edited and displayed on the pixel level. The isometric projection is commonly seen in games to provide a 3D view without using any real 3D processing. Technically, lines with a 1:2 pixel ratio are picked, leading to an angle of about 22.6 degrees, which pixels created by would follow a neat pattern.<p/>
	 * Pixas is an Open Source ActionScript? engine, which enables programmers to build isometric pixel Flash Applications with pure ActionScript3?. With Pixas you can easily add isometric pixel elements like brick, cube, pyramid, map layer to your applications.
