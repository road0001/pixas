	 * Pixel art is a form of digital art, where images are edited and displayed on the pixel level. 
	 * <p/> The isometric projection is commonly seen in games to provide a 3D view without using any real 3D processing. 
	 * <p/> Technically, lines with a 1:2 pixel ratio are picked, leading to an angle of about 22.6 degrees, 
	 * <p/> which pixels created by would follow a neat pattern.
	 * <p/> Pixas is an Open Source ActionScript engine, 
	 * <p/> which enables programmers to build isometric pixel Flash Applications with pure ActionScript3.0
	 * <p/> With Pixas you can easily add isometric pixel elements like brick, cube, pyramid, map layer to your applications.
